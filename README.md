# **Battle Guy**
## *A Java-Based 2D Battle Strategy Game*
*Battle Guy* is going to be a 2D turn-based strategy game, made entirely with the base Java packages.

This project's base display and movement is heavily influenced by the **first half** of [RyiSnow's 2D Game Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_QPQmz5C6WUF-pOQDsbsKbaBZqXj4qSq)

Following the base overworld movement, my unique implimentations will include:
- Battle simulations
- Moves
- Stats
- Items
- Inventory
- Etc.
